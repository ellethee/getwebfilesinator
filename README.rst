GetWebFilesInator
=================
GetWebFilesInator (gwfi) is a simple file downloader to keep your javascript
and css libraries up to date. Is not perfect but is easily configurable and
for simplest tasks can be more suitable than a real dependency manager.

All you need is to know were your libraries are and a yaml o json configuration
file.
